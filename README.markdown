### Export


- **All Documents as JPG in**  (No shortcut)

  Exports all pages as JPG with the highest quality (100).  
The commands prompts you for a folder to export, and files are saved with the document's name plus '_page_X' as the file names.  
It also changes the Optimize settings for all pages, because I hate the "GIF as default format" :)

- **All Pages as PNG 24 in**  (No shortcut)

  Exports all pages as flattened (non editable) PNG files with a 24 bits color depth.  
The commands prompts you for a folder to export, and files are saved with the page names as the file names.  
It also changes the Optimize settings for all pages, because I hate the "GIF as default format" :)

- **All Pages as PNG 24 with Prefix**  (No shortcut)

  Exactly as 'All Pages as PNG 24', but asks for a prefix to be added before each page's name.  
This command is useful when you have a complex nomenclature for files, but don't want to fill your Pages panel with it :)

  Exports all pages as flattened (non editable) PNG files with a 24 bits color depth.  
The files are saved in a folder named YYYYMMDDHHMMSS (i.e: 20091028170642) inside the current folder, with the page names as the file names.  
It also changes the Optimize settings for all pages, because I hate the "GIF as default format" :)

  Exports all pages as PSD files.
The command prompts you for a folder to export, and files are saved with the page names as the file names.

- **Current Page as PNG 24 in**  (No shortcut)

  Exports the current page as a flattened (non editable) PNG file with a 24 bits color depth. The file is saved in the same folder as the current file, with the page name added to the current file name.
I.e: if your file is called CoolDesign.png, and the current page is called 'Home', the command creates a file named CoolDesign_Home.png

- **Slices as CSS Sprite**  (No shortcut)

  Exports the slices in the current document as a .css file. This way, you can use your PNG file as a sprite. This mostly useless in CS6, as the feature is included in this version, but it's nice for earlier versions.

### Export Settings


- **Set PNG 24 for All Pages**  (No shortcut)

  A command to set the export format of all pages as PNG in 24 bits (something that is currently *so* time consuming and convoluted that it makes you want to cry)

  A command to set the export format of all pages as PNG in 32 bits (something that is currently *so* time consuming and convoluted that it makes you want to cry)

Specially built for <http://limalimon.com.es>

- **Set Page Name**  (CTRL + SHIFT + P)

  Asks for a new name for the current page. This command was born out of frustration with the way page names are edited in Fireworks CS3. If your page names have more than 10 characters, it's really hard not to get crazy editing names :)

- **Sort**  (No shortcut)

  Sorts the pages in alphabetical order.

- **Vertical Trim All Pages**  (CTRL + SHIFT + T)

  Trims all pages vertically, fitting the contents. It does not modify the width of the pages.

  Trims the current page vertically, fitting the contents. It does not modify the width of the page.  

### Position


- **Fix Position**  (CTRL + F)

  This command tries to fix a nasty bug where Fireworks will draw an item at a subpixel position. The command also tries to fix the width and height of the item so that they become integer numbers. Why Adobe thought it would be useful to draw using half pixels is beyond me...

- **Set Position**  (CTRL + P)

  It asks for the new position in x,y coordinates.

- **Swap**  (No shortcut)

  Swaps the position of two selected objects.

### Properties


- **Set Rectangle Roundness in Pixels**  (CTRL + R)

  Sets the selection corner roundness in pixels (something that is not possible in CS3). Useful when you want to set the same roundness in a collection of rectangles with different sizes.
This command only makes sense for CS3, as CS4 lets you specify roundness in pixels.

### Select


- **Text Objects**  (No shortcut)

  Selects all text objects in the current page.
Extremely useful when you need to change the font for all text in a page.

### Size
A collection of commands to resize objects.

If multiple objects are selected, each one will be transformed independently.

All Size commands support math operations, so you can quickly make an object 23 pixels wider, or half its height, or...

**Bonus points:** if the selected object is a Text box, you can use a width of '0' to have it automatically resize to fit the content without wrapping.


- **Height +1**  (CTRL + DOWN)

  Increment selected object’s height by 1 pixel.

- **Height +10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + DOWN)

  
- **Height -1**  (CTRL + UP)

  Decrease selected object’s height by 1 pixel.

- **Height -10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + UP)

  Decrease selected object's height by 10 pixels.

- **Height**  (CTRL + H)

  Sets the height of the selection.

- **Scale to 16-9**  (No shortcut)

  This command scales the selected object(s) so that they have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

- **Scale to 4-3**  (No shortcut)

  This command scales the selected object(s) so that they have a 4:3 aspect ratio.

- **Scale to Fit...**  (No shortcut)

  This command scales the selected elements to fit specified dimensions, preserving their aspect ratio.

  This command scales the selected object(s) proportionally so that they have the specified height while maintaining their aspect ratio.

- **Scale to Width**  (CTRL + SHIFT + ALT + W)

  This command scales the selected object(s) proportionally so that they have the specified width while maintaining their aspect ratio.

- **Set Size**  (CTRL + S)

  Sets selected object’s size. It asks for the width and height in w,h format. Supports math operations.

- **Width +1**  (CTRL + RIGHT)

  Increment selected object’s width by 1 pixel.

- **Width +10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + RIGHT)

  Increment selected object’s width by 10 pixels.

- **Width -1**  (CTRL + LEFT)

  Decrease selected object’s width by 1 pixel.

- **Width -10**  (CTRL + SHIFT + LEFT)

  Decrease selected object’s width by 10 pixels.

- **Width**  (CTRL + W)

  Sets the width of the selection.

### States


- **Duplicate State**  (No shortcut)

  This command duplicates the current state. It was created to work around a bug in Fireworks CS6, where duplicating states would not duplicate symbols. There's a small glitch, though: if you had locked objects in your states, they will be unlocked on the new state. It's a small price to pay, IMHO, but I'll keep trying to make it work properly.

### Text


- **Arialize Selection**  (CTRL + A)

  Sets currently selected text blocks to Arial.

- **Autokern Toggle**  (No shortcut)

  Toggles the 'Auto kern' property of selected text objects.
